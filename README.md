# HORTUS - A Plant Tracking Application ðŸŒ±
#### (*Latin:* Garden)


*What does the application do?*
1) Allows user to create/delete individual profiles for each plant they own, 
each profile will show the plant name, species, days since purchase, watering status
   (last watering time, next watering time), and additional notes.
2) Has a to-do list that lists the upcoming watering time for each plant that allows 
users tick off the check-boxes once the task is done.


*Who will use it?*

 - Plant carers who wish to record information about their plants and 
track their plant watering status.


*Why is this project of interest to me?*

- During summer break, I bought a lot of plants and had trouble keeping track of the time to water them. 
I tried many different apps on my phone, but they either require paid premium subscription
or doesn't include a watering reminder feature that I wanted. So I thought this would be useful tool for 
myself as well as other plant caretakers.
